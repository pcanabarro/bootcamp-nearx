### Why security?

During 2023, $47B were lost by hackers and only 901 million dollars were recovered. Next year this number decreased to $1B, this numbers shows how the security on blockchain is very important and needs to be studied.

If there´s a bug in blockchain and it´s not fixed, your service/code will stay with the bug until someone fix it deploying again, you can not stop your service on blockchain.
